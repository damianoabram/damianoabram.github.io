I am a <b>PhD student</b> in the <b> [Crypto Group](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/) </b> at <b>Aarhus University</b> (since August 2020). I am supervised by [Peter Scholl](https://pascholl.github.io/) and [Ivan Damgård](https://cs.au.dk/~ivan/).

My research focuses on <b>theoretical aspects of cryptography</b>. Among my main interests are <b>multiparty computation with minimal interaction</b> (non-interactive MPC, homomorphic secret-sharing, pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs), pseudorandom correlation functions (PCFs) and distributed samplers), <b>advanced cryptographic primitives</b> (such as obfuscation and homomorphic encryption) and the study of security models, especially in their idealised forms.

From October 2022 to February 2023, I visited [Yuval Ishai](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~yuvali/) at Technion, Haifa.
From June to August 2022, I worked as an intern at NTT Research (USA) under the supervision of [Mark Zhandry](https://mzhandry.github.io/).

In 2020, I earned a <b>master's degree in mathematics</b> from the University of Trento (Italy), graduating with honours. The studies were focused on cryptography and coding theory. The master thesis, titled <em><b>Oblivious TLS via Multiparty Computation</b></em>, was supervised by Ivan Damgård, Sven Trieflinger and Roberto Zunino.

In 2017, I obtained a <b>bachelor's degree in mathematics</b> from the University of Padova (Italy), graduating with honours. The bachelor thesis, concerning Wiener's attack against RSA, was supervised by Alberto Tonolo.
