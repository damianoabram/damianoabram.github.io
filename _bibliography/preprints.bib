  abstract	= {Distributed samplers, recently introduced by Abram, Scholl and Yakoubov (Eurocrypt 2022), are a one-round, multi-party protocol for securely sampling from any distribution. We give new lower and upper bounds for constructing distributed samplers in challenging scenarios. First, we consider the feasibility of distributed samplers with a malicious adversary in the standard model; the only previous construction in this setting relies on a random oracle. We show that for any UC-secure construction in the standard model, even with a CRS, the output of the sampling protocol must have low entropy. This essentially implies that this type of construction is useless in applications.
Secondly, we study the question of building distributed samplers in the party-dynamic setting, where parties can join in an ad-hoc manner, and the total number of parties is unbounded. Here, we obtain positive results. First, we build a special type of unbounded universal sampler, which after a trusted setup, allows sampling from any distributed with unbounded size. Our construction is in the shared randomness model, where the parties have access to a shared random string, and uses indistinguishability obfuscation and somewhere statistically binding hashing. Next, using our unbounded universal sampler, we construct distributed universal samplers in the party-dynamic setting. Our first construction satisfies one-time selective security in the shared randomness model. Our second construction is reusable and secure against a malicious adversary in the random oracle model. Finally, we show how to use party-dynamic, distributed universal samplers to produce ideal, correlated randomness in the party-dynamic setting, in a single round of interaction.}

 abstract	= {{The assumption that certain computations inherently require some sequential time has established itself as a powerful tool for cryptography. It allows for security and liveness guarantees in distributed protocols that are impossible to achieve with classical hardness assumptions. Unfortunately, many constructions from the realm of time-based cryptography are based on new and poorly understood hardness assumptions, which tend not to stand the test of time (cf. Leurent et al. 2023, Peikert & Tang 2023).
In this work, we make progress on several fronts. We formally define the concept of a delay function and present a construction thereof from minimal assumptions. We show that these functions, in combination with classical cryptographic objects that satisfy certain efficiency criteria, would allow for constructing delay encryption, which is otherwise only known to exist based on a new hardness assumption about isogenies. We formally define randomness beacons as they are used in the context of blockchains, and we show that (linearly homomorphic) time-lock puzzles allow for efficiently constructing them. 
Our work puts time-based cryptography on a firmer theoretical footing, provides new constructions from simpler assumptions, and opens new avenues for constructing delay encryption.}}

  abstract	= {We propose a new method to construct a public-key encryption scheme, where one can homomorphically transform a ciphertext encrypted under a key
 $<b>x</b>$ into a ciphertext under $(P, P(<b>x</b>))$, for any polynomial-time RAM program $P: <b>x</b> &#8614 <b>y</b>$ with runtime $T$ and memory $L$. Combined with other lattice techniques, this allows us to construct:
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    1. Succinct-randomised encodings from RAM programs with encoder complexity $(|<b>x</b>|+ |<b>y</b>|) \cdot poly(log T, log L)$ and rate-1 encodings.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    2. Laconic function evaluation for RAM programs, with encoder runtime bounded by $(|<b>x</b>|+ |<b>y</b>|) \cdot poly(log T, log L)$ and rate-1 encodings.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    3. Key-policy attribute-based encryption for RAM programs, with ciphertexts of size $O(T)$. The same scheme can be converted to the register setting, obtaining linear CRS size in the number of parties.</p>
    <p>All of our schemes rely on the hardness of the <em>decomposed learning with errors</em> (LWE) problem, along with other standard computational assumptions on lattices. The decomposed LWE problem can be interpreted as postulating the circular-security of a natural lattice-based public-key encryption scheme. To gain confidence in the assumption, we show that it is implied by the hardness of the succinct LWE problem of Wee (CRYPTO'24).</p>}
